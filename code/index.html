          <h3> Chicago Crime Heat Map </h3>
          <p>I wrote a python script that parses chicago_clean.csv into data.tsv, which contains the day, hour, and value, which is the number of crimes during that day in hour. In crime_times.js, I created a heat map encoding the amount of crime that takes place during a certain day and hour. Darker colors indicate more crime for that day and hour, as indicated by the legend.</p>
          <div class="graph" id="chart"></div>
          <p> From the graph, it looks like most crimes take place during the evening, after the sun has set, when it's harder for criminals to be caught in the darkness. Because of the scale, the the darkest cells indicate several times more crimes than the lighter cells. 

          <h3> Transcontinental Train Schedule </h3>
          <p> Using the train schedule data of trains that travel across the country, I created a visualization inspired by Marey's trains that encodes distance as well as time. The y-axis shows the cities that the trains go to separated by the distance between them. The x-axis shows the schedule times. Mousing over each train's path will show the exact schedule times for each train.  </p>
